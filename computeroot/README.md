## Deployment

CPU: 593s 49s/step
GPU: 167s 13s/step

almost 4x faster training.

### Architecture 

2 nodes: 
  - web node (serves static content)
  - compute node (handles POST requests to classify boards)

As more user data is uploaded to the compute node, the data is stored to further improve the models
The compute node follows roughly the following flow on user upload and user feedback

On new image: POST {file: "..."} to /cv_algo (checked on frontend)
  - give image unique_id
  - extract board
  if success:
    - save raw in ./user_uploads/raw_success/
  else:
    - save raw in ./user_uploads/raw_fail/
    - return {error: "msg"} to user
  - classify pieces (+ logic)
  - return {result: "fen", id: "..."} to user (front end produces feedback button)
  - save board in ./user_uploads/unlabelled/boards/
  - save predictions in ./user_uploads/unlabelled/predictions/ (same id + .json)

On new feedback event: POST to /feedback {id: "...", correct: true}
  if correct:
    - save all squares in board from ./user_uploads/unlabelled/boards/id to ./user_uploads/squares/<b, n, ...>/
  else: 
    - copy board from ./user_uploads/unlabelled/boards/id ./user_uploads/fail/boards/id
    - copy prediction from ./user_uploads/unlabelled/predictions/id ./user_uploads/fail/predictions/id
    - delete board from ./user_uploads/unlabelled/boards/id
